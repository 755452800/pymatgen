# pymatgen.analysis.hhi module

This module is used to estimate the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, or HHI, of
chemical compounds. The HHI is a measure of how geographically confined or
dispersed the elements comprising a compound are. A low HHI is desirable
because it means the component elements are geographically dispersed.

Data/strategy from “Data-Driven Review of Thermoelectric Materials:
Performance and Resource Considerations” by Gaultois et al., published
in Chemistry of Materials (2013).
